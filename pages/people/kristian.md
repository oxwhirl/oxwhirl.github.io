I am a PhD student at WhiRL, advised by Shimon Whiteson. My research interests are in machine learning, robotics, and vision. Most recently I've focused on model-free deep reinforcement learning for real-world robotic control. I also spend some of my time working on open-source projects like [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) and [Softlearning](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/softlearning).

Prior to joining WhiRL, I did research at Robotic AI and Learning Lab (RAIL) at the University of California, Berkeley, where I worked with Sergey Levine and Tuomas Haarnoja on model-free reinforcement learning and robotics. I also spent a couple of years as a software engineer in the industry, building statistical analysis and machine learning products at Statwing and Qualtrics. I did my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science in Aalto University, Finland.
