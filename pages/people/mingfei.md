I am a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford University (jointly with Microsoft Research Cambridge), working closely with Shimon Whiteson and Katja Hofmann. Before joining Microsoft, I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research focuses on developing and analyzing state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods for application to video games.
